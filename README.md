## Features

- Responsive design: The website layout adjusts to fit different screen sizes, such as mobile phones and tablets.
- Navigation menu: A menu that allows users to navigate to different pages on the website.

## Inspiration

This project is an inspiration from a personal project where three software engineers and myself built and 
deployed. The only main difference is that this solo project contains less features, deployed through Vercel 
instead of Render, and commits are pushed to GitHub instead of GitLab. I managed to get my work to this 
project.

## Stretch goals

- pricing component for each bartender (hourly rate, or fixed fee)
  - filter by price range
- go from statewide to multi-state to nationwide
- ability for hosts/bartenders to communicate on the website by sending messages
- Users leave reviews for bartenders, and bartenders leave reviews for users
- Bartenders can create custom drinks and upload an image for the drink
- incorporate external API for financial side (Stripe for example)
- bartender being able to serve multiple cities
- build out a footer
  - include things such as About Us section and Contact Us section
- build out the availability (date and time) for each bartender
